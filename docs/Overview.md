## Article metadata
Follow these rules to modify article properties within a Freshdesk article.

# Tags for product pricing table
Each article has a pricing plan on top that shows which SKUs and tiers apply to the article. 
Use the following tags to add that table. Features in a tier are available in every higher tier, so each tag cascades upwards. Add only the tag for the lowest applicable plan per product SKU.
Colons can be used to align columns.
